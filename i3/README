If you want to use my config, be sure to have the following:

i3-gaps
imagemagick and scrot (for the lock command)
pulseaudio (for screencast or audio capture; athough if you know how, you can easily change it to your alsa if that's all you use.)

Be also sure that the i3 folder is in your ~/.config directory.

Also, be sure to get the bumblebee-status (github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status) for the status bar, although be sure to change the theme to one of the defaults. (This may also require you to use pip to download some new Python modules (like netifaces or psutil).
